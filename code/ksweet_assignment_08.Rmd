## Your assignment

The goals for this assignment are to:

- practice making maps with the various packages
- think about composition and the grammar of graphics
- critique various maps

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have several static maps displaying the datasets we've used in the last few weeks.

# Task 1: Show me your ugly maps!!
Find 2 examples of maps that you think are 'bad'. 

![EDM Songs on Pandora.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AnLp-hwFUEjkW9TxSt_U1-rv8k=/0x0:1198x777/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1198x777):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3420378/pandora.0.jpg)

![Hogs.](hogs.png)

_Question 1_ Why are they bad? What might improve them? 
Although I love the edm map and reminiscing about pandora, extracting any information from the map is difficult because of the complicated key and similar colors. Choosing different colors, or selecting few songs (for example the 5 most popular edm songs nationwide, and which one ranks highest in eacg state) could simplify the visual information. It's also possible that this information might not be displayed well as a map. The hog map is confusing in how it chooses to display what I guess would be considered hog density. Each dot  represents thousands of hogs, but how the dots are spatially distributed on the map is misleading, given that it seems highly unlikely hogs always occur in units of 5,000. Doing some kind of state or county by county numbers could fix this issue.

_Question 2_ Rely on the Healy and Wilke texts to provide some structure to your answers.
The hog map could be improved using a chlorpleth map of counties, with darker colors representing highest hog density, as suggested by Healy. In regards to the EDM data set, as the Wilke text implies, the map's author is asking color to do too much. If color indeed is the most popular song in every state, that could be dozens of distinct colors which would be too much for the viewer to mentally keep track of. Further, there needs to be larger color variation aside from a few shades of blue.

# Task 2: Load your libraries and build a dataframe
You can choose whichever datasets you'd like from the past several months as the subject for your mapping. You'll need to use at least one tabular join, one spatial join, and one extraction to create the dataframe. Load the packages, the data, and make sure everything is projected here. Give me a sense for what you are hoping to map.

# Task 3: Build a map with Tmap
Practice making a quick map with tmap. 

```{r}

  tm_shape(land.value.proj) +
  tm_raster("Regval", palette=viridis(n=50),legend.show=FALSE, legend.hist = TRUE, legend.hist.title = "Land Value")+
tm_shape(regional.pas.sf) +
  tm_polygons(col = "land.val") +
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)+
  tm_shape(state)+
  tm_borders()
  
  mammals.proj<-as(mammals.proj, "Raster")

  tm_shape(mammals.proj) +
  tm_raster("Value", palette = viridis(n=10), n=10, legend.show=TRUE, legend.hist.title = "Species Richness")+
  tm_shape(indig) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Value", palette=viridis(n=10)) +
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)+
  tm_shape(state)+

# Task 4: Build a choropleth with ggplot
Your map should have a basemap, should rely on more than one aesthetic (color, transparency, etc), and combine multiple layers.
```{r}
#why do I have to grab the file from tigirs- why won't it work directly with sf objects I have? (st_box)
az <- tigris::states(cb=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(STUSPS == "AZ") 

bg <- ggmap::get_stamenmap(as.vector(st_bbox(az)))
land.value.proj<-as(land.value.proj, "Raster")


ggmap(bg) +
   geom_sf(data = indig, mapping = aes(fill =  land.val), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=az, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))

ggmap(bg) +
      geom_sf(data = gini.income.county, mapping = aes(fill = medianincome, alpha=0.1), inherit.aes = FALSE)+
  geom_sf(data = indig, mapping = aes(fill = meaninc),color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE)+
  geom_sf(data=az, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="magma")+
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))


```


# Task 5: Build 2 cartograms
Follow the examples to build cartograms that display your region of interest based on variables other than area.
```{r}

# gini 
az_gini <- cartogram_cont(gini.income.county, "gini", itermax = 5)
az_income <- cartogram_cont(gini.income.county, "medianincome", itermax = 5)

# 
tm_shape(az_gini) + tm_polygons("gini", style = "jenks") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 


tm_shape(az_income) + tm_polygons("medianincome", style = "jenks") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 
```

_Question 3:_ Reflect on the different maps you've made, what do the different visualizations tell you about the data you plotted?
It looks like on average there's a lot of mammal species richness in reservation land of arizona when compared to the rest of the state. 
Protected areas generally had lower land values.
The median income in the Navajo Nation also appears lower than that of other tribal reservations in Arizona. 

_Question 4:_ How might you improve the maps you've made?
The maps I made in tmap with adding raster layers weren't useful to visualize things that I cared about. I think what might have been more useful would be to have just the outlines of regions of interest for a more useful and detail comparison of either protected or indigenous lands versus the remainder of the state. Looking at the gini index in relationship to population could also be helpful.

_Question 5:_ Is a map the best way to evaluate the data you worked with? Why or Why not?
For some things it was appropriate. For example, is speciess richness greater in an rea designation of interest or outside of it? Similarly, visualizing county income's and gini scores were interesting. I think looking at a map was a fine way to investigate the data, but some of the maps could have been improved to be more useful to the question at hand outside of assignment requirements. I did find the cartograms very interesting in the context of looking at measures across the state. I think I will probably use this visualization a lot when exploring census variables at large scales.
